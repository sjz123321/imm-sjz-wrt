Description:  The Open Mobile Alliance Lightweight M2M protocol is a machine to machine communication protocol built over COAP, and meant to communicate resource constrained devices. The protocol defines two roles for the devices: a Lightweight M2M Client (the constrained device) and a Lightweight M2M Server (meant to consume the device data and control its execution).
